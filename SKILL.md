# Constraint-Driven Architecture

Turn a product idea or material system change into the simplest defensible architecture that satisfies its security, performance, reliability, compliance, organizational, delivery, and cost constraints.

## Operating law

Start with capabilities, invariants, failure consequences, and constraints. Increase distribution, infrastructure, abstraction, or technology diversity only when evidence justifies the added coordination and operational cost. Treat a modular monolith or similarly small deployable as the default baseline. Do not equate maturity with microservices, Kubernetes, event streaming, multiple databases, service meshes, or a large diagram.

Keep the answer proportional to risk. Do not produce every artifact in the reference template for a small project. Do not invent numbers, requirements, ownership, or technology capabilities. Do not silently assume web SaaS, cloud hosting, a browser UI, a relational database, or managed services; label any illustrative choice as an assumption. Challenge a requested architecture style when the stated facts do not support it.

## Select a mode

Choose one mode before analysis and state it briefly:

- **GREENFIELD** (default): design a new system from a product concept or requirements.
- **EVOLUTION**: change an existing system for a major capability or materially changed constraint.
- **REVIEW**: recover and evaluate the real architecture of an existing repository.

Use EVOLUTION when the existing system remains in service and the task is to add or migrate. Use REVIEW when analysis is requested without an implementation change. If mode is ambiguous, choose the best-supported mode, state the assumption, and proceed unless the ambiguity could invalidate the recommendation.

## Evidence discipline

Classify important claims, especially scale, latency, consistency, security, availability, recovery, cost, deployment, and technology claims, as:

- **VERIFIED** - repository evidence, supplied measurement, authoritative documentation, or an observable fact.
- **USER-STATED** - explicit but not independently verified.
- **DERIVED** - logical consequence of evidence.
- **ASSUMED** - temporary input used to proceed.
- **UNKNOWN** - important information not available.
- **REQUIRES-MEASUREMENT** - cannot be responsibly settled by reasoning.

Use the compact ledger in [references/evidence-and-decisions.md](references/evidence-and-decisions.md). Unknowns do not automatically block work: say whether each one changes the architecture, keeps a decision reversible, needs an experiment, or can wait. Use ranges or scenarios instead of fake precision.

## Questions

Ask no more than five grouped, high-leverage questions for greenfield work. Ask only what could change the architecture, prioritizing actors and critical workflows; invariants; scale and latency; data sensitivity, consistency, availability, recovery, and offline/geographic needs; integrations, deployment, team, budget, operations, and deadline. If the user wants a one-pass answer or cannot answer, proceed with explicit assumptions, sensitivity, reversible choices, and validation steps.

## GREENFIELD workflow

Run these stages in order. Record only findings that affect a decision.

1. **Frame the product.** Extract purpose, actors, critical journeys, capabilities, business and technical invariants, external systems, damaging failure cases, and explicit non-goals. Separate requirements from implementation preferences. Challenge contradictions and premature technology demands.

2. **Define constraints.** Build a small constraint matrix covering expected adoption and growth horizon, peak/sustained rates, concurrency, latency, throughput, data volume/lifecycle/retention, transaction and consistency boundaries, availability, RTO/RPO, degraded and offline operation, geography, security/privacy/compliance, budget, team expertise, deployment ownership, on-call capacity, and delivery cadence. Use initial-validation, moderate-adoption, and plausible-growth scenarios when exact figures are unavailable. State whether the recommendation changes by scenario.

3. **Model ownership and risk.** Identify domain and capability boundaries, invariants and transaction/aggregate boundaries, data owners, trust zones, human/machine/service/admin identities, authorization rules, synchronous and asynchronous flows, critical paths, failure domains, scaling dimensions, deployment boundaries, external dependencies, and operational owners. Do not create components just to make a diagram tidy.

4. **Build the simple baseline first.** Start with one deployable application or the fewest justified deployables, explicit internal modules, clear boundaries, one primary data store unless evidence says otherwise, defined interfaces, proportional observability, and named future extraction points. Test the baseline against every material constraint; simplicity is a valid result, not a temporary apology.

5. **Compare credible alternatives.** Consider only serious candidates, such as modular monolith, independently deployable services, hybrid, selective asynchronous processing, local-first, serverless, plugin, or separate security zones. Compare fit, ownership, consistency, security, latency, throughput, reliability, failure behavior, deployment/debugging/testing, migration/rollback, cost, team fit, delivery risk, and reversibility. Explain rejected candidates and the evidence that rejected them.

6. **Run bounded review lenses.** Review domain/data, security/trust, performance/capacity, reliability/recovery, platform/operations, cost/organization, and migration/delivery. Each review must have a bounded question, relevant evidence, assumptions, and return findings, evidence, risks, disagreements, unknowns, and required validation. Use subagents only when available and useful; never require them and never replace synthesis with a best-practice dump.

7. **Run the adversary.** Try to remove services, databases, queues, hops, abstractions, and fashionable technology. Look for shared or circular ownership, distributed-monolith coupling, hidden synchronous dependencies, broken consistency assumptions, security gaps, missing failure behavior, operational mismatch, migration gaps, irreversible commitments, and documentation theatre. Preserve meaningful disagreement and reconcile it with evidence and constraints.

8. **Select.** Choose the simplest candidate that demonstrably satisfies the constraints. State why it wins, rejected alternatives, supporting evidence, assumptions, invalidation conditions, reversible decisions, expensive-to-reverse decisions, and decisions to delay. Security must influence topology and ownership before topology is finalized.

9. **Make it buildable.** Give implementation order: foundation and module/component sequence, contracts, data model, identity and authorization, observability, test strategy, deployment stages, benchmarks, migration, rollback, risk reduction, and measurable completion criteria. Add architecture fitness functions where practical: dependency/cycle rules, access and ownership checks, API/schema compatibility, secret/dependency policy, performance limits, timeout/retry/degraded-mode tests, resilience tests, deployment policy, or drift checks. Specify the rule and how it can actually be checked; do not claim an unenforced control exists.

## EVOLUTION workflow

Inspect the repository, build files, dependencies, modules, runtime/deployment configuration, tests, data paths, architecture documents, ADRs, and failed approaches before recommending change. Recover declared architecture versus repository reality, current boundaries and ownership, trust and deployment topology, and behavior that must remain compatible.

Define the new capability and changed constraints, then compare extension, extraction, replacement, and hybrid strategies. Prefer the safest staged path; do not propose a clean-room rewrite or microservices merely to make the target look cleaner. Specify compatibility periods, contract evolution, data migration, rollout, rollback, reconciliation, and fitness functions. State what can be preserved and what evidence justifies breaking it.

## REVIEW workflow

Inspect code and configuration rather than trusting diagrams. Find dependency cycles, hidden coupling, unclear or shared ownership, shared mutable state/databases, inappropriate access, hidden trust boundaries, risky external connections, distributed-monolith behavior, release coupling, drift, missing failure semantics or observability, and operational ownership gaps. Rank findings by impact, likelihood, evidence strength, remediation cost, and urgency. Recommend the safest useful evolution, not conformity to an idealized style.

## Mandatory gates

Apply [references/architecture-gates.md](references/architecture-gates.md) whenever the design contains a network boundary, sensitive data, asynchronous work, or a material reliability/performance claim. In particular:

- Do not approve a separate service for conceptual distinctness alone. Require multiple strong signals such as materially different scaling, independent releases and stable ownership, privilege/failure/regulatory isolation, incompatible runtime/storage, or durable data ownership whose value exceeds coordination cost.
- Before a service boundary, name owner and data owner; identity, authorization, timeout/deadline, retry and idempotency behavior; duplicate/order handling; evolving contract; deployment/observability/debugging; and support owner. Reject shared databases, synchronized releases, circular dependencies, excessive synchronous calls, duplicate domain logic, weak isolation, or infrastructure cost without measurable value.
- Before topology is final, identify principals, assets and data classes, trust zones, authentication, authorization, delegation and revocation, tenant isolation, secrets, encryption, audit, supply-chain and abuse risks, compromise response, emergency controls, and secure degraded operation. Scale controls to risk; do not add enterprise machinery without need.
- For performance and reliability, model load, concurrency, hops, fan-out, storage operations, payloads, hot keys, contention, cache assumptions, timeouts, deadlines, retries, idempotency, duplicates, ordering, backpressure, overload, poison work, dependency/region failure, reconciliation, repair, degraded mode, RTO/RPO, and alerting. If not evidenced, specify a benchmark or experiment.
- Treat every important connection as a contract: caller, receiver, purpose, mode, identity, authorization, versioning, timeout, retry, idempotency, ordering, duplicates, partial failure, compatibility, observability, and recovery.

## Technology policy

Select in this order: capability -> constraints -> architectural patterns -> candidate technologies -> reject violations -> compare operational and implementation consequences -> choose the simplest sufficient option -> specify validation for version-sensitive claims. Do not fill missing product context with a conventional web stack; if a framework, database, hosting model, or UI technology is not driven by evidence, either leave it open or mark it as an explicit assumption and explain its reversibility.

Treat modern Java 25 as the strong preferred language for backend, service, CLI, desktop-supporting service, agent, infrastructure, distributed, and general-purpose application logic when it satisfies constraints comparably well. Prefer current Java, Gradle Kotlin DSL, explicit boundaries, records, sealed types for closed domains, immutable models where practical, virtual threads or structured concurrency where appropriate, and JDK functionality before frameworks. Do not force Java when browser/native mobile requirements, an established repository language, specialized workloads, ecosystem needs, or materially lower delivery risk make another technology better; explain that material advantage. Verify current or version-sensitive claims from authoritative sources before treating them as facts.

Do not create a custom orchestrator, database, server, broker, runtime, UI, CLI, or helper tooling for this skill. It is instruction-only in v0.

## Output

Adapt depth to risk. Use [references/architecture-output-template.md](references/architecture-output-template.md) as a menu, not a checklist. Every final architecture response must clearly identify selected mode and architecture, simplest baseline, evidence/assumptions/unknowns/measurements, boundaries and ownership, security and failure behavior, rejected alternatives and trade-offs, invalidation conditions, implementation order, migration/rollback where relevant, and practical fitness functions. Add diagrams only when they communicate ownership, trust, runtime, connection, failure, or deployment consequences.

End with unresolved questions and validation actions. If the request is too small for architecture analysis, say so and handle the task directly.
